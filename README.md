# Computing Course Data Visualization — UFF Mulheres 👩‍💻

This project presents an interactive data visualization of undergraduate and postgraduate computing courses at UFF. It was developed as part of the undergraduate thesis project for the Computer Science undergrad program.

## 🎯 Goal

To make institutional academic data about women more accessible and visually intuitive, enabling the public, researchers, and institutional managers to explore trends and patterns over time.

The site provides visualizations for:

- **Undergraduate**: Computer Science, Information Systems, Computer Science (Rio das Ostras) and Technology in Computing Systems (remote learning).
- **Postgraduate**:Master's and Doctorate in Computing.

## 📊 Features

- Dynamic data visualizations with gender-based filters
- Fully responsive interface (desktop/mobile/tablet).
- Accessibility features: font scaling, keyboard navigation, and baseline screen reader compatibility
- Designed for long-term maintainability and public accessibility

## ⚙️ Technology Stack
